I'm not sure if I'm a good fit for doing anything with respect to climate change.  I am looking at switching to, 
e.g. AI, or, if not that, then some other EA-aligned thing.
Question 1: Why am I thinking of doing this?
Question 2: Why would it be unwise to do this
Question 3: Is my current decision-making algorithm stupid, and if so, how to repair?

Question 1:
I've been studying SET at TU Delft for two years now - I've been reasonably involved in the climate / energy space, enough to get a feel for things.
The primary problem, more important than the rest, is that I don't see a path to impact that uses my comparative advantage.
I've seen friends who have an impressive grasp on analysing tech from the "engineer's perspective" that I thought I could have.
Turns out, this is a skill that I don't, by default, have.  Now I presumably could develop this skill - if I were to, what then?
Do I have any especial insights into energy policy?  None that aren't derived from a paper I've read, or a podcast I've listened to;
furthermore, most of my opinions in this space are opinions for the sake of having them - they're frankly not epistemically honest, and I couldn't make
them be so without a lot of work.
Further, it seems like, if any career is to be high-impact, it would be something like policy - here I may have a relative disadvantage due to my
lack of empathy with other people.  If I were to go the policy-route, I don't know that I could produce anything of value.
On the other hand, the academic route seems pointless too - if technology is already so highly developed that it's macroscale 
predictable (like solar learning-curves), what could I possibly have to add?  Presumably all I could do is step into the middle of the 
process and just help others push the boulder up....
Then, there's "politics", but I think the appeal of this to me is the appeal of being a character people could elect - not even power, but self-image.
While it would be 'cute' to become a congressman, would I be willing to sacrifice for it?  Probably not much.  Would I bring anything unique to the table?
Maybe, but to the extent that I do, it would be just smuggling in other peoples' ideas to political respectability; and to the extent that politicians
are ostensibly bound by their constituents, it doesn't seem like I'd have the latitude to act as I see fit.
And it's worth mentioning, but I think not serious, that I don't see any of these as fun - I mention this only lightly, because I believe that I could
plausibly change this by becoming really invested in something and working hard on it - then it might be.  But on the other hand, we come to question 2:

Question 2:
